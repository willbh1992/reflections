What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a .git repository inside the directory you intialize it in
	after which you can then start saving commits and use git functions on that directory which is now a repository. Do it so you can use git funtions to track commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
